# 0.1.1 (2023-10-10)

## Added

* Added logging support (based on `log = "0.4.20"` crate).
* Added a [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG) file (i.e. this file).

## Changed

* (Breaking) Added `Error::EmptyStdout` variant.
* (Breaking) Added `Message::Done` variant.
* Added optional `ffmpeg_path` setter method to the `Settings` structure,
so the user can now specify the path of the FFmpeg library to use when spawning the child process.
* Fixed a few typos and improved docs.

## Misc

* The library was tested with `ffmpeg version 6.0-tessus` on macOS
and appears to be working fine with that version as well (i.e. in
addition to `ffmpeg version 5.0-tessus`).
