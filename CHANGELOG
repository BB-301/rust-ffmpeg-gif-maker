# 0.1.1 (2023-10-19; 4th deployment)

## Changed

* Updated README file with link to repository that uses the library.

# 0.1.1 (2023-10-09; third deployment)

## Changed

* Made some improvements in `Converter::convert`.
* Fixed example in [docs/lib.md](./docs/lib.md), because was missing new `Message::Done`
variant.

## Added

* Added `converter.rs::tests::test_converter_blocking_cancelled_job` to confirm that converter
works as expected when cancelling a job.

# 0.1.1 (2023-10-07; second deployment)

## Changed

* Fixed an issue in the `Converter::convert` implementation: `stdin`Â thread would
not return after a successfully completed job.
  * API did not change so kept version to `0.1.1`.
* Fixed a mistake in this very file: previous entry had been marked
as `2023-10-10` but should have been `2023-10-07`.

# 0.1.1 (2023-10-07; first deployment)

## Added

* Added logging support (based on `log = "0.4.20"` crate).
* Added a [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG) file (i.e. this file).

## Changed

* (Breaking) Added `Error::EmptyStdout` variant.
* (Breaking) Added `Message::Done` variant.
* Added optional `ffmpeg_path` setter method to the `Settings` structure,
so the user can now specify the path of the FFmpeg library to use when spawning the child process.
* Fixed a few typos and improved docs.

## Misc

* The library was tested with `ffmpeg version 6.0-tessus` on macOS
and appears to be working fine with that version as well (i.e. in
addition to `ffmpeg version 5.0-tessus`).
